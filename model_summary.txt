🧠 CNN Model Summary – Hyperparameter Optimization using DOE

This project utilizes a tunable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

🧱 Architecture Overview:
- 🌀 Conv2D Layer(s): 1 to 4 layers, kernel sizes ranging from 1 to 11
- 🔽 MaxPooling2D: Reduces spatial dimensions
- 📄 Flatten: Converts 2D feature maps to 1D vector
- 🔢 Dense Layer(s): 50 to 300 neurons based on experiment design
- 🧮 Output Layer: 10 neurons (Softmax activation for classification)

⚙️ Optimizer: SGD with Momentum  
📉 Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy  
📊 Evaluation Metric: Validation Accuracy

🧪 Experimental Setup:
